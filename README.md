# Strigolactone-Binding-JBC2021
This repository contains data analysis code used for the strigolactone binding paper.

## contact\_analysis
Related to Fig. 3a-b, scripts used to compute and compare protein-ligand contact probabilities for the two proteins.

## general\_sim\_analysis
In-house code used to perform adaptive sampling, plot free energy landscapes, and compute protein-ligand and inter-residue distances.

## msm\_construction\_validation
Scripts to compute and validate Markov state models

## pocket\_analysis
Related to Fig. 6, scripts used to perform analysis of the binding pockets.

## sequence\_analysis
Related to Fig. 3e-f, scripts used to determine most frequently occuring residues at key sites.

## standard\_binding\_calc
Scripts to compute standard binding free energy from simulations using the method described in Buch _et al._, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. **2011**
